This directory contains all the resources and the tools that compose the "Document Alignment Workflow" described in the ACCURAT deliverable D2.6. Version 3.
The present bundle is compiled ONLY FOR Windows systems (!) and contains the following tools:

Requirements:
- 'perl' and 'java' must be in the %PATH%.
- IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that for EMACC, the user edits the cluster.info  (see D2.6 for that) file and run on multiple CPU cores since the algorithm is CPU intesive.
- be sure to use the environment variable USER to your user in cmd.exe! That is, 'echo %USER%' MUST NOT BE VOID! GIZA++ breaks if this does not happen.
